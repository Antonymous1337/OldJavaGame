# OldJavaGame
An old java game I made several years ago

The last edit I made to this game was in June 11, 2020.

It was a student project where I was asked to make a simple pong game...
but instead I made this full on Bullet Hell game (with the teachers permission of course)

If in a rush you can just check the code and the images above without downloading the game

Opening or running the .pde file (the game) on your computer may require the download of the Processing engine
You can download it here: https://processing.org/
